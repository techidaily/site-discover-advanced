ABBYY® released a major update for its advanced scanner and contact manager [ABBYY Business Card Reader](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.abbyy.mobile.bcr.lite&referrer=utm%5Fsource%3Dpress-release-eng%26utm%5Fmedium%3Dpost%26utm%5Fcampaign%3Dbcr4.7) named among top business apps by [The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/30/technology/personaltech/transforming-paper-business-cards-ito-digital-contacts.html?post%5Fid=1066245850155424%5F1066246506822025#%5F=%5F), [CNN](http://edition.cnn.com/2014/12/23/business/smart-business-best-apps/), [The Telegraph](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/businessclub/11011490/Top-ten-must-have-apps-for-small-businesses.html), [Computer Business Review](http://www.cbronline.com/news/mobility/apps/5-business-card-apps-to-bring-your-rolodex-into-the-21st-century-4664945), [Android Headlines](http://www.androidheadlines.com/2015/01/featured-top-10-business-card-scanner-apps-android.html), etc. Now Android users can enjoy new features like autofocus and auto crop, perfect the image through manual editing and color filters, view it in the full screen mode and export their contacts to MS Excel, as well as save both sides of a business card – all that with higher processing speed.

A winner of the Mobile Star Award, ABBYY BCR still allows to digitize business cards in 25 languages with unprecedented speed and accuracy. However, the updated version boasts enhanced computer vision enabling the app to “see” the business card, identify the contours, take a photo and crop the background out – completely automatically. The manual crop helps to further refine the edges while color filters and perspective correction – to sharpen and improve the image quality.

What’s more, ABBYY BCR for Android has become 50% faster and now it only takes 5 seconds to digitize a business card!

The updated version virtually re-creates the scanned business card in your smartphone. The app allows to save both sides of the business card, then view in detail in the full screen mode.

To easily search and manage your contacts you can export them as a data base in CSV format and then work with it in MS Excel on your desktop or laptop as well as import into CRM systems.

“I am very happy we managed to automate the scanning and cropping without compromising the quality, accuracy or speed. We were able to make the app much smother and faster. I think our users will appreciate it”, – comments Artem Kumpel, ABBYY Vice President and Head of Mobile.

Just as before, BCR users have access to the business card data base from devices across platforms and can save their contacts in the Cardholder within the app and in the cloud. Sharing options include SMS and email. Built-in search in the social media like Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter makes professional networking effortless and effective.

ABBYY Business Card Reader is compatible with Android 4.0.3 or later and is available in two versions: free and Pro. Free version gives access to all the features except synchronization for 10 business cards. To get full-feature access with unlimited scanning, users are advised to buy ABBYY Business Card Reader Pro for $14.99.
