### 3\. Coronavirus Pandemic Reveals the Need for a Broader Digital Front Door

Last year, we saw that healthcare facilities and providers around the country experienced COVID-19 differently and continue to. The crisis has led many healthcare leaders to evaluate how they can decrease the need for physical services while maintaining the quality of care and providing individualized services. On HIT Consultant, we discussed the new front door of the healthcare system and how a digital strategy is no longer a nice-to-have.

### 7\. Want to be a Leader in the Digital-First Era? Upskill Your Workforce

The pandemic has led to a new global remote workforce, pushing companies to find innovative ways to increase operational efficiencies and streamline workflows. Social distancing has prompted many organizations to explore new digital channels, innovate service delivery models, and entirely reimagine the way in which they serve their customers. In doing so, it set a new standard for the skills their workforce required. However, these skill sets are in short supply. The world of work as we know it will never be the same. But are employees ready for the future of work?
