TRANSPORTATION & LOGISTICS Keep Shipments Moving with Intelligent Automation 

Key industry trends and how to unlock their potential Reoccurring disruptions, economic and inflationary pressure, changing demand, and geopolitical uncertainty have affected the transportation and logistics industry like no other. The turbulent last few years have left all players with a sense of urgency to future-proof their operations in five important ways, with automation, digitization, and artificial intelligence (AI) being key enablers. Digitization Automation AI Sustainability Traceability Efficiency Resilience Agility 2 

The problem with digitization and automation in transportation and logistics Shipping processes are heavily reliant on a large set of complex documents, which are often shared with multiple parties in hard copy format. Despite decades of attempts to standardize the format and electronic exchange of key documents such as bill of lading, there is still only moderate success, due to the complexity and number of parties involved. A key challenge in achieving operational excellence in transportation and logistics remains disparate legacy systems, which hinder achieving end-to-end transparency of processes. Although autonomous driverless trucks, drone delivery, exoskeletons, and artificial intelligence (AI) are exciting players in the automation journey within transportation and logistics, there remain a few fundamental steps toward digital transformation in the industry that first must be addressed: 3

Rapidly advance your automation journey with intelligent document processing Powered by AI Low-code / No-code Pluggable Pre-trained Adapt on the fly Fast Accurate Transportation and 3PL providers are tackling these key roadblocks to modern digital transformation with AI-based, low-code intelligent document processing (IDP). IDP automates the classification, extraction and processing of data from documents, making shipping processes run more efficiently, accurately, and with greater visibility. ABBYY’s IDP platform, Vantage, offers pre-trained and ready-to-go document extraction models, called document skills, for shipping documents. You can kick-start your automation in a couple of hours and constantly improve quality thanks to powerful machine learning. ABBYY Vantage 5 

5 WAYS TO FUTURE-PROOF YOUR OPERATIONS WITH INTELLIGENT AUTOMATION 

5 WAYS TO FUTURE-PROOF YOUR OPERATIONS WITH INTELLIGENT AUTOMATION documents processed annually 1.8 million The events of recent years have proven that it is crucial for supply chain participants to employ modern technologies such as AI, machine learning, and predictive analytics for more resilience. But to do so, they need better access and insights into data currently trapped in paper documents or disparate, outdated systems. Use intelligent automation to: Build an interactive digital twin of processes, analyze them in real time, and monitor compliance. Automatically capture data from trade documentation of any complexity and ingest it into business systems for further processing and analysis. Validate extracted data against pre-defined business rules or across documents. Resilience: Tap into the power of your documents and data 1 — Rhenus Assets & Services GmbH & Co. KG 7 

5 WAYS TO FUTURE-PROOF YOUR OPERATIONS WITH INTELLIGENT AUTOMATION How quickly can your transportation and logistics operations adapt to meet fast-changing demands and forces beyond your control? Regulatory change such as US interstate tax codes, Brexit, trade policies, and tariffs means new forms and procedures. Unexpected regional or worldwide events drive demand up (or down) and present logistical changes. Competitive disruption can come from new sources (big tech but also from old competitors adopting new technologies like drone delivery and autonomous trucks). Agility: Adapt easily to handle the impact of changing regulations Use intelligent automation to: Modernize and connect systems and processes without disrupting IT infrastructure. Remove friction from processes and remain competitive by increasing your control and visibility of information contained within the many varied types of documents that drive operations. Adapt to changing regulations and requirements quickly with low-code / no-code intelligent document processing, where the citizen developer is enabled to control the process. Pass data from important, time-critical documentation onto business systems using API or pre-built connectors. 2 8 

from standardization of global processes with ABBYY intelligent document processing 70% efficiency gain — Deutsche Post DHL Group 5 WAYS TO FUTURE-PROOF YOUR OPERATIONS WITH INTELLIGENT AUTOMATION In the fast-paced world of logistics, every minute counts. If information isn’t right or can’t be verified at any point in the shipping process, costly delays occur including service level agreement (SLA) failures, additional fines, demurrage charges, and excess labor and fuel costs. Customers and stakeholders rely on real-time transparency on the whereabouts of their shipments for planning of resources and production. Use intelligent automation to: Capture documents with a mobile device any time, any place, and let the IDP system identify document type, language, and what needs to be extracted. Extract and verify the necessary information against business rules or across documents. Reduce errors, costs, and accelerate turnaround times by automating the handling of the entire document set of a shipment. Efficiency: Gain time and improve accuracy with better document processing 3 9 

5 WAYS TO FUTURE-PROOF YOUR OPERATIONS WITH INTELLIGENT AUTOMATION When hours can cost tens of thousands of dollars to a shipper or customer, any delay can be disastrous. Today’s digitally savvy customers want to answer their own questions about where their goods are in the process—right from their cell phones. Improving visibility into and control over document content doesn’t just bring you operational benefits, it makes you more competitive. Use intelligent automation to: Turn in-cab, hand-held, depot, and other devices into real- time validation and clearance to keep shipments moving. Meet the expectations of your customers for complete traceability and visibility of their shipments’ status. Improve the accuracy and currentness of the information in your shipping processes and thereby increase the confidence of your commercial customers that their shipments will arrive on time. Traceability: Boost your retention rate in supplier query response, down from one week to two days 60% reduction — Leading global digital infrastructure provider 4 10
