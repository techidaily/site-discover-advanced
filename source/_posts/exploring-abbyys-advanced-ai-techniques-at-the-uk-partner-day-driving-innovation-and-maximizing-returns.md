## ABBYY’s UK Partner Day Highlights Innovation and ROI Using AI

April 23, 2024

Earlier this year, in a standing-room only event held at the Chartered Accountants' Hall in London, we hosted our first Partner Day of 2024, where organizations learned how they can leverage ABBYY's purpose-built AI solutions to drive impactful results. The event illuminated the exponential growth and success of the intelligent automation market, with a focus on how AI can help put information to work to accelerate results and improve customer experiences.

Partners gained insights into ABBYY's pivotal role in the competitive AI landscape and shared real-world case studies highlighting our joint success stories in healthcare and transportation and logistics. Curious what you may have missed? Read on for a recap of the insightful day. Subscribe to the ABBYY blog to stay up to date with upcoming partner days across the globe, and other news in intelligent automation. 

#### What is the competitive landscape of the AI market? 

Despite some claims that intelligent document processing (IDP) is obsolete, Max Vermeir, ABBYY’s Senior Director of AI Strategy, highlighted that the market remains fragmented, presenting a prime opportunity. He explored how to understand the hype from reality, plus costs versus benefits of competitive offerings to navigate and choose the best solutions. Tune in to this episode of AI Pulse hosted by Max and featuring guest Bruce Orcutt, as they explore the [state of the AI market in 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT0%5Fw7Av5kg&list=PLcawcg-HXtXeE7L%5FeP5yIE8vg64jhaUXj).

#### How the NHS found success with ABBYY Vantage and Extra Technology 

Extra Technology showcased the transformative power of [ABBYY Vantage](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/), for fully automating invoice processing and reducing payment risk at the Manchester NHS Trust, where thousands of different types of invoices are processed a year. With ABBYY’s continuous machine learning capabilities, post-processing and data validation, invoicing times were significantly reduced, freeing up staff to focus on other business-critical areas and yielding cost-savings in the millions. 

This achievement underscores ABBYY's ability to put the information of our valued customers to work, improve processes, and drive significant change in weeks rather than months or years. 

Adopting ABBYY IDP has resulted in an evolution of our function and our staff, expanding their skillset in a way that feels a lot more stable, with a tool they know is reliable and is pushing things in the right direction.

#### How to streamline freight processes with ABBYY 

Intelligent document processing (IDP) can have tremendous positive impact for transportation and logistics organizations. In the intricate world of supply chain, the movement of freight relies heavily on paperwork. Each cross-border transaction demands an average of 36 documents, yet shockingly, less than one percent of these vital papers are digitized. With a staggering 50 million bills of lading issued annually, and a mere two percent being electronic, it's evident that the industry's reliance on paper documentation persists, echoing practices dating back decades. 

ABBYY delivers in complex scenarios, accurately, and with real-world impact. These are three benefits ABBYY intelligent automation delivers for transportation and logistics. 

Attending the ABBYY Partner Sales Enablement Day was an enriching experience that exceeded my expectations. ABBYY provided insightful presentations, collaborative discussions, and valuable networking opportunities. I appreciate the organizers' dedication to creating such a valuable event and myself and my whole team look forward to applying what we've learned to strengthen our partnerships and achieve mutual growth. Thank you for a fantastic day!

Vanessa Kelly, Head of Marketing, PSV

#### How intelligent document processing (IDP) addresses complexity 

McKinsey research reveals that many shipping processes remain entrenched in the past, harking back to the practices of the 1400s; however, ABBYY emerges as a beacon of efficiency amidst this complexity and not just for bill of lading documents. Leveraging pre-built skills and IDP, ABBYY bridges the gap by modernizing paper documentation into digital workflows. ABBYY’s purpose-built solutions deliver pre-trained AI models (document skills) and machine learning for data extraction, validation, and automated exception handling in the [transportation and logistics sector](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/), among many others. 

**Achieving efficiency and accuracy with purpose-built AI** 

ABBYY's solutions for intelligent automation help to streamline operations, ensure compliance, and drive efficiency gains. With ABBYY IDP, paper-based processes in transportation can be automated within hours and pass accurate data to transportation systems using simple API and pre-built connectors. With 95 percent and higher out-of-the-box accuracy, your organization can accelerate business process automation across multiple departments and processes in a fast, reliable, and simple way. 

**Realizing real-world impact of AI-powered business transformation** 

Organizations like [Carlsberg Group](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/), [AFS](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/), and [Deutsche Post DHL Group](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) have reported significant benefits, including time savings, faster turnaround, and enhanced efficiency in their business units powered by ABBYY. By automating tasks such as proof of delivery, contract management, and shipment tracking, ABBYY empowers organizations to navigate the complexities of transportation and logistics with ease. 

These examples underscore the pivotal role of our strategic partnerships, as we innovate solutions with ABBYY’s purpose-built AI technologies for our customers, driving growth and success in today's competitive landscape. Partners left the event equipped with actionable insights, valuable connections, and a deeper understanding of how to leverage intelligent automation to meet the evolving needs of their clients. 

The partner event really showed how far ABBYY and Vantage have developed and how much further the development journey will go to deliver greater value and more importantly time to value for our customers looking to work with Stratas to automate document intensive operations and processes.
