## Welcome to The Intelligent Enterprise 

######   
by Ulf Persson  

Demand for IT in 2023 is expected to be strong as enterprises push forward with digital business initiatives in response to economic turmoil. Worldwide IT spending is projected to total $4.6 trillion in 2023, an increase of 5.1% from 2022, according to the latest forecast by Gartner, Inc.

_[Gartner Forecasts Worldwide IT Spending to Grow 5.1% in 2023](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2022-10-19-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-it-spending-to-grow-5-percent-in-2023), Oct. 19, 2022_

Just when we thought we heard enough of “unprecedented,” we again find our global markets experiencing new challenges.

But this time, company leaders are not so caught off guard as they were in 2020 by Covid-19 and are more prepared for the eventual economic downturn.

Still, many of the same challenges exist: volatile market conditions, reduced workforce, more demanding customer expectations, stricter budget controls, and increasing competition. The balancing act to appease investors, employees, and customers takes a more collaborative and intentional effort that is driving leaders to seek technology to digitally transform their business and augment their workforce.

However, there is a noticeable slowing in information technology (IT) decision-making. The haste during the pandemic to bypass standard sales cycles has left many organizations with technical debt and siloed solutions that haven’t made the impact promised. This has caused decision makers to untangle and reassess their automation solutions and be more prudent with future investments.

It’s for these reasons that we are debuting **_The Intelligent Enterprise_**, where each quarter we share our customers’ experiences and applicable insights to help your digital initiatives succeed faster. In this issue, we address common issues relating to augmenting full-time employees’ productivity, improving the customer experience, best practices from government agencies, and even how intelligent automation is making the world a safer place.

You’ll learn how Banner Health improved its claims processes and saved employees 2,100+ hours in administrative tasks, and results from a global survey revealing how more than 1,600 IT decision makers plan to improve onboarding. You’ll see how global organizations are hopeful, fearless, and are making their enterprises smarter.

In future issues of _The Intelligent Enterprise_, we’ll feature interviews with innovation and automation leaders who are transforming their organizations to improve how they work and make their customers’ lives better.

Threaded throughout, you’ll see how ABBYY transforms the content running through enterprise applications into knowledge that drives more intelligent decision-making and more powerful results faster–which are essential in today’s economic climate.
