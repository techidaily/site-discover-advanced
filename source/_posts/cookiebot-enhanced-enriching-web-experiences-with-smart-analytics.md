#### _Now available in Western Europe: New language-based ABBYY Smart Classifier helps businesses to get a grip on big content, sort unstructured information and turn it into action_ 

ABBYY®, a leading provider of technologies and solutions to action information today announced the availability of ABBYY Smart Classifier on the European market. The new product enables businesses to leverage and act on complex, unstructured information by delivering highly accurate document classification. Based on Compreno®, ABBYY’s innovative natural language processing (NLP) technology, Smart Classifier quickly organises large repositories of documents according to both statistic and semantic analysis of content. Once classified, information is ready for search and retrieval, automated routing, intelligent data extraction and decision-making.

Allocating relevant information to the responsible entity at the right time is key in today’s fast-paced world. However, the vast majority of incoming data is unstructured, which hinders businesses from automated, machine-based access and processing – and from using it to their advantage.

“ABBYY Smart Classifier empowers companies to derive value from the data stream that constantly pours into their business,” says Jupp Stoepetie, CEO of ABBYY Europe. “Documents are automatically assigned to predefined categories on the basis of their content. This language-based insight into information creates new opportunities to optimise critical business processes – including information governance, data migration, content management and client support.”

ABBYY Smart Classifier is a scalable server-based document classification module for categorising unstructured information based on statistics, morphology and semantics. It comes with different components for setup and training. The module integrates into existing IT systems via a REST API. This way, Smart Classifier becomes an intelligent element within corporate content management systems including archives, knowledge bases and document management systems. For software vendors, OEM licensing is available.

With ABBYY Smart Classifier, software developers and integrators can extend their existing product portfolio with easy-to-use document classification. Empowered by machine learning technology, it enables them to develop next generation smart business applications that deliver high-quality classification results. The intuitive Model Editor interface for classification model setup, training and quality check makes ABBYY Smart Classifier highly responsive to organisations’ information management and business process requirements. Combined with automatic parameter tuning during model creation, it helps organisations overcome implementation and usage complexities that have hindered widespread adoption of classification technology.

Smart Classifier is based on the scalable ABBYY Compreno technology, which forms the core for a new generation of intelligent analytic and discovery solutions that solve the task of effectively processing unstructured data. Compreno understands the meaning of words, defines relationships between them and creates semantic representations that enable text to be analysed by computers for accurate information extraction, classification and intelligent search.

“With Smart Classifier, ABBYY enters a new path in document classification,” Stoepetie says. “Transparency of business critical documents is important, as organisations look to improve retention policies, mitigate risk and ensure legal regulations are properly met. Customers, especially in the healthcare, banking, legal, manufacturing and insurance sectors, deal with complex document sets, strict compliance requirements and a large proportion of unstructured information. These enterprises can now locate essential information efficiently and make critical decisions faster whilst at the same time support overall business agility, improve customer satisfaction and maximise the return on investment.”
