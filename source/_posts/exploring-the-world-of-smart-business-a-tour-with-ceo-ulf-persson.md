## Exploring the World of Smart Business: A Tour with CEO Ulf Persson

[Back to The Intelligent Enterprise](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/)

## Welcome to The Intelligent Enterprise 

######   
by Ulf Persson  

Demand for IT in 2023 is expected to be strong as enterprises push forward with digital business initiatives in response to economic turmoil. Worldwide IT spending is projected to total $4.6 trillion in 2023, an increase of 5.1% from 2022, according to the latest forecast by Gartner, Inc.

_[Gartner Forecasts Worldwide IT Spending to Grow 5.1% in 2023](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2022-10-19-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-it-spending-to-grow-5-percent-in-2023), Oct. 19, 2022_

Just when we thought we heard enough of “unprecedented,” we again find our global markets experiencing new challenges.

But this time, company leaders are not so caught off guard as they were in 2020 by Covid-19 and are more prepared for the eventual economic downturn.

Still, many of the same challenges exist: volatile market conditions, reduced workforce, more demanding customer expectations, stricter budget controls, and increasing competition. The balancing act to appease investors, employees, and customers takes a more collaborative and intentional effort that is driving leaders to seek technology to digitally transform their business and augment their workforce.

However, there is a noticeable slowing in information technology (IT) decision-making. The haste during the pandemic to bypass standard sales cycles has left many organizations with technical debt and siloed solutions that haven’t made the impact promised. This has caused decision makers to untangle and reassess their automation solutions and be more prudent with future investments.
