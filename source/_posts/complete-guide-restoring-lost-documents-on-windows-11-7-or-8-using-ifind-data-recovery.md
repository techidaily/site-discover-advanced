## 

### **1\. How Recover Deleted Files from the Recycle Bin (Empted or Not Empted)?**

Always check the Recycle Bin first before you empty it! If you just press the Delete button or drag the files or folders into the Recycle Bin, all you need to do is open it on your desktop. Check the files you want back, right-click the file, and then press Restore.

### **2\. How to Restore Deleted Files With Previous Versions Tabs in Windows PCs?**

Except for the Windows Backup, there is also a built-in function in Windows called “Shadow Copy” which we can use for recovering deleted files on Windows PCs. Microsoft added it from Windows XP and made lots of improvements in the following Windows 7, Windows 8/8.1, Windows 10, and Windows 11\. There are some differences listed.

| Windows 11/10 | Windows 10 brings the “Previous Versions” tab back from Win8, but Microsoft rebuilds it on a whole new function called “File History” now in place of the old “Volume Shadow copy”. Windows 11 is also the same. |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Windows 8     | The shadow copies function is still there, but the “Previous versions” tab was removed, nonetheless, you can still use the 3-part tools to retrieve.                                                             |
| Windows 7     | Windows system will automatically build a shadow copy (as a restore point) daily, or manually. The function called “Previous Versions” is also added in Win7                                                     |
