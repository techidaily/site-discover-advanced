## Method 1: Check your Recycle Bin for a deleted document

If you are not familiar with Recycle Bin operations or have some issue with it, check our tips for Recycle Bin Recovery below

## Method 2: recover deleted/lost document with word Autosave and Autorecover

Like unsaved document recovery, we can also recover the deleted word files in the same way. Word will monitor your documents and create recoverable files automatically. When word detects your files deletion or missing, there may be a Recovery pane coming up when you reopen the word.

If Word didn’t find anything, you still could search the Autorecover files Manually by the following steps:

1. Open the windows explorer or windows search
2. Search for \*.asd files
3. Use word to open the files

There may be some differences between the word versions to open autorecover files.

* [Word 2003](https://tools.techidaily.com/ifind-recovery/products/)
* [Word 2007](https://tools.techidaily.com/ifind-recovery/products/)
* [Word 2010/2013/2016/2019](https://tools.techidaily.com/ifind-recovery/products/)

* [Word 2003](https://tools.techidaily.com/ifind-recovery/products/)

**File** – **Open** – **Files of type** – **All Files**

![Files of type](https://i0.wp.com/www.ifind-recovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Files-of-type.jpg?resize=640%2C202&ssl=1)

* [Word 2007](https://tools.techidaily.com/ifind-recovery/products/)

**Microsoft Office** – **Open** – **Files of type** – **All Files**

* [Word 2010/2013/2016/2019](https://tools.techidaily.com/ifind-recovery/products/)

**File** – **Open** – **Files of type** – **All Files**

If you open the .asd files successfully then congratulations, you get your documents back!

## Method 3: recover deleted/lost word file with Word Backup files

It’s almost the same process for search autorecover files, Instead, search for backup files AKA \*.wbk, Usually you will see this backup files name started with the term “Backup of”.

![word backup files recover](https://i0.wp.com/www.ifind-recovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/word-backup-files.jpg?resize=640%2C200&ssl=1)

## Method 4: recover deleted/lost document with Word temporary files

We also talk about this at unsaved files recovery article, use windows search or windows explorer to search for temporary files with extension .tmp and remember to check the temp file name start as “\~” carefully.

![word tmp](https://i0.wp.com/www.ifind-recovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/word-tmp.jpg?resize=552%2C168&ssl=1)

## Method 5: Recover deleted/lost word file from system or software backup
