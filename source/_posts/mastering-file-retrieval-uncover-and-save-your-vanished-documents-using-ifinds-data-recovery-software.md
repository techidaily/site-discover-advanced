## How To Recover A Deleted/Lost Word Document

* ![How To Recover A Deleted Lost Word Document](https://www.ifind-recovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/how-to-recover-deleted-lost-word-document.jpg)

Last week we posted a tip about [how to recover unsaved word document](https://tools.techidaily.com/ifind-recovery/products/), and we may also face other issues for word recovery, such as you permanently deleted your important 30-page word file by accident or you can’t find the document after a system crash or file corrupted.

Today we will show you some tips about lost/deleted word file recovery.

## 1, how to recover deleted and lost word document

Like we said before, there is always a chance to retrieve word document after you files deleted or lost, even after you empty the Recycle Bin. To recover deleted word document, you can follow the next methods:

## Method 1: Check your Recycle Bin for a deleted document

Typically, The word files we deleted will move to Recycle Bin immediately. You can find and recover a deleted document easily if you don’t use “Shift+Del” for a permanently delete. If you are not familiar with Recycle Bin operations or have some issue with it, check our tips for Recycle Bin Recovery below

## Method 2: recover deleted/lost document with word Autosave and Autorecover

Like unsaved document recovery, we can also recover the deleted word files in the same way. Word will monitor your documents and create recoverable files automatically. When word detects your files deletion or missing, there may be a Recovery pane coming up when you reopen the word.

If Word didn’t find anything, you still could search the Autorecover files Manually by the following steps:

1. Open the windows explorer or windows search
2. Search for \*.asd files
3. Use word to open the files

There may be some differences between the word versions to open autorecover files.

* [Word 2007](https://tools.techidaily.com/ifind-recovery/products/)
* [Word 2010/2013/2016/2019](https://tools.techidaily.com/ifind-recovery/products/)

* [Word 2003](https://tools.techidaily.com/ifind-recovery/products/)

**File** – **Open** – **Files of type** – **All Files**

![Files of type](https://i0.wp.com/www.ifind-recovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Files-of-type.jpg?resize=640%2C202&ssl=1)

* [Word 2007](https://tools.techidaily.com/ifind-recovery/products/)

**Microsoft Office** – **Open** – **Files of type** – **All Files**

* [Word 2010/2013/2016/2019](https://tools.techidaily.com/ifind-recovery/products/)

**File** – **Open** – **Files of type** – **All Files**

If you open the .asd files successfully then congratulations, you get your documents back!

## Method 3: recover deleted/lost word file with Word Backup files

It’s almost the same process for search autorecover files, Instead, search for backup files AKA \*.wbk, Usually you will see this backup files name started with the term “Backup of”.
