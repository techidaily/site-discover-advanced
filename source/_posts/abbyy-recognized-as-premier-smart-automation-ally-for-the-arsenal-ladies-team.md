In the world of sports and innovation, certain partnerships exceed traditional boundaries and inspire greatness. ABBYY is excited to announce its [partnership with Arsenal Women](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/), a collaboration that embodies the spirit of innovation, integrity, and empowerment.

Since its inception in 1987, [Arsenal Women](https://www.arsenal.com/women)'s journey has been nothing short of extraordinary. With an impressive collection of 60 trophies, they are the [most successful women's team in the UK](https://www.arsenal.com/women/honours). Notably, they are the sole football club in the United Kingdom (UK) to secure a Champion's League victory. The team's achievements are an inspiration to aspiring athletes worldwide. Arsenal Women's current squad is a remarkable blend of talent, diversity, and experience, featuring players from eight different nationalities. Among them are renowned figures like Euro 2022-winning [captain Leah Williamson and Golden Boot winner Beth Mead](https://www.arsenal.com/women/players). Let's delve into the essence of this exciting partnership and what it means for both organizations.

At the heart of this partnership lies a shared commitment to innovation. ABBYY's mission is to transform data from any source into intelligent, actionable insights. Our hyper-focus on research and development (R&D) is evident in the proprietary technologies ABBYY has been developing for decades, and industry analysts including IDC and ISG Provider Lens have recognized ABBYY as a leader for delivering solutions that stand out from the crowd.

Similarly, Arsenal Women have redefined football with their innovative team-oriented tactics and commitment to efficiency and excellence on the pitch. This collaboration will provide a platform to showcase the collective impact of driving innovation and moving forward. By using the strengths of both organizations, this partnership is set to raise the bar in their respective fields.

The ABBYY and Arsenal Women partnership is more than a strategic alliance; it's a connection built on shared values. Both organizations value progress, teamwork, and uphold a standard of excellence. This common ground has solidified the cultural fit between the two, enabling a strong foundation for collaboration.

As we look ahead to this exciting partnership, the potential for positive change is immense. The ABBYY and Arsenal Women partnership is a platform to reach a rapidly growing women’s football fan base – according to the Financial Times two billion viewers tuned in to the FIFA Women’s World Cup 2023 - with messages of innovation, leadership, and empowerment. With a near four-fold increase in viewing hours of the Barclays FA Women’s Super League in 2021 and 2022, as well as two-thirds of football enthusiasts showing more interest in UK women’s football following the Euros, the potential for meaningful investment in the sport is undeniable.

Just as Arsenal Women have changed the landscape of women's football, ABBYY is revolutionizing data transformation and intelligent automation. This partnership symbolizes the potential of collaboration to drive change on multiple fronts, as investment in women’s sports from organizations like ABBYY [advances equity](https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/16/womens-sports-investment-deserves-the-same-consideration-tech-receives/) by driving viewership, attendance, and fan engagement with women’s leagues, teams, and athletes.

Investment in women’s sports leagues, teams, and athletes — from organizations, brands, communities and beyond — will advance equity within all sports. Viewership, attendance, revenue, and fan demand are all up.

[_TechCrunch, 2023 "Women’s sports investment deserves the same consideration tech receives"_](https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/16/womens-sports-investment-deserves-the-same-consideration-tech-receives/)

### Happy, but not satisfied: celebrating wins while looking ahead

The partnership with ABBYY and Arsenal Women highlights our commitment to supporting gender equity and equality, diversity, and inclusion – a powerful mission rooted in ABBYY’s history. ABBYY has been supporting female athletes for years through our sponsorship of PFU BlueCats volleyball team in Japan. Challenging the gender gap in the tech industry, we are proud of our above-industry-average representation of women in the workplace. Women at ABBYY represent over 35 percent of our workforce (compared to the tech industry average of 28 percent), and more than a third of our team leaders.![Arsenal Womens](https://www.abbyy.com/-/jssmedia/project/Abbyy/Abbyy/Insights/Blog/let-get-real-abbyy-x-arsenal-women/Arsenal-Women-2.png)
