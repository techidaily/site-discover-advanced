**ABBYY Compreno Surpasses Traditional Data Capture and Text Analytics by Understanding Contextual Meaning, Facts and Story Lines in Business Documents**

ABBYY®, a leading provider of technologies and solutions to action information, is excited to announce that ABBYY Compreno has been named one of [KMWorld Magazine’s Trend-Setting Products of 2016](http://www.kmworld.com/Articles/Editorial/Features/KMWorld-Trend-Setting-Products-of-2016-113140.aspx).

KMWorld covers the knowledge, content and document management markets. With more than 21,000 print subscribers, the publication seeks innovative software products that allow businesses to be more efficient within the enterprise.

“Each year we look for software products that break new territory in helping organizations achieve their knowledge management goals,” said Sandra Hamila, editor, KMWorld. “These products are designed, developed and perfectly timed to fill a niche in the marketplace before users are even aware that such functionality and flexibility have been missing. Designated as the KMWorld Trend-Setting Products of 2016, these offerings hold the promise for the marketplace.”

Compreno builds on ABBYY’s history of innovation in natural language processing document recognition and capture to deliver enhanced functionality to customers. As the industry’s most comprehensive language-based technology for smart business process applications, Compreno surpasses traditional capture and text analytic solutions by understanding contextual meaning, facts and story lines within business-critical documents. This enables decision makers to leverage data sets of complex unstructured information to accelerate their critical business processes and decision making.

“Our judging panel agrees that such characteristics as usefulness, scalability and level of innovation are among the most valuable components that we consider when we annually select the KMWorld Trend-Setting Products,” said Hamila. “And the panel believes that timing is key. Too late in the market and competitors already have a foothold. Too early and customers are nowhere to be found.”
