* When an SD card is accidentally formatted or deleted, but the partition is good to use, the ‘**File Recovery**’ mode can be used to restore photos and files.
* It is recommended to use the ‘**Partition Recovery**’ mode if your partition is damaged. SD cards are not suitable for this option since they are single-partition devices.
* The ‘**Resume**’ feature enables you to save the scan and recovered results every time you operate the recovery process of iFinD Data Recovery. So that it can directly read your saved recovery result regardless of scan and recover the files on your device again and again.

**Step 3:** After selecting ‘File Recovery’. Then you will see a partition list of your device, select the one that represents your SD card. Usually, it’s marked with USB FLASH DRIVER, USB DEVICE, etc. Now you can start to scan your SD card.
