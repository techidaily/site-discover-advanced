The advantages of SD cards are compact, easy to carry, and fast transmission. However, the stability is not good, and there is some human error. Sometimes the computer can not read the SD card full of files and photos. It’s a very painful thing.

## 2: How To Recover Deleted Photos From an SD Card Free?

[iFinD Data Recovery Free](https://tools.techidaily.com/ifind-recovery/products/) lets you recover up to 1GB of photos and images for free! It helps you easily recover any file type of picture including JPEG, PNG, GIF, and all other common and uncommon picture formats. And it allows you to retrieve your photos from many devices, for instance, SSD, USB, SD, CF, and most used camera storage cards.

**Step 1:** Do not overwrite your SD card! Most importantly, it means DO NOT paste, delete, or create anything new on the SD card now. Remove it from your digital device ASAP.

**Step 2:** Free download and install iFinD Data Recovery software. Launch the software and you can see that it has a very friendly user interface. Now press on the button ” File Recovery”.

![Photo Recovery](https://i0.wp.com/www.ifind-recovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/soft_1.png?resize=1100%2C645&ssl=1 "soft_1")

* When an SD card is accidentally formatted or deleted, but the partition is good to use, the ‘**File Recovery**’ mode can be used to restore photos and files.
* It is recommended to use the ‘**Partition Recovery**’ mode if your partition is damaged. SD cards are not suitable for this option since they are single-partition devices.
* The ‘**Resume**’ feature enables you to save the scan and recovered results every time you operate the recovery process of iFinD Data Recovery. So that it can directly read your saved recovery result regardless of scan and recover the files on your device again and again.

**Step 3:** After selecting ‘File Recovery’. Then you will see a partition list of your device, select the one that represents your SD card. Usually, it’s marked with USB FLASH DRIVER, USB DEVICE, etc. Now you can start to scan your SD card.

**Step4:** Smart AI Scanning

* 1: Cancel: Choosing this option ends the scanning process and returns you to the device selection page of the second step. Please make sure you select this option carefully.
* 2: Pause: When you click this button, the scanning process will be paused and the found files displayed. If the file you need is found, you can click the “Resume” button to continue scanning.
* 3: A real-time display will show the number of files found. There will be pictures, media, compression, and documents displayed from top to bottom.
