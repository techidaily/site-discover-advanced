## Why do world-leading developers choose to use ABBYY SDKs?

More and more software developers are working to incorporate advanced Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and data capture into their applications and solutions. The ability to capture printed information and make it digital is an important capability, especially in info-intense fields like financial services, healthcare, banking, and high-tech industries.

But why spend months writing your own technology and struggling with solutions that provide limited capability?

  
ABBYY offers a suite of professional grade capture tools in our family of SDK products that work together to provide a platform for success.
