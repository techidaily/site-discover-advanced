_Ulf Persson, CEO at ABBYY_

IDC estimates1 the [Worldwide Intelligent Process Automation (IPA) market](https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=US45411620) will reach $30.5 billion in 2024, which includes the use of automation planning tools that provide the data and statistical analysis to deliver automation faster and more effectively, and the use of AI to automate activities that would formerly be automated manually. ABBYY’s [Digital Intelligence](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) platform is key to delivering these capabilities with its industry-leading Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) and Process Intelligence solutions which allow ABBYY’s customers to identify intelligent automation opportunities, understand the processes, content, and manual tasks that drive them, while extending RPA and other automation platforms with AI-based automated document processing.

The decision to partner with ABBYY was based on our extensive market research highlighting ABBYY’s solution strength reflected in its superior technology, scale and customer satisfaction. We saw meaningful potential for continued acceleration in growth across ABBYY’s solutions addressing process automation for enterprises globally. We are extremely excited to partner with ABBYY and continue to drive innovation and value for its customers.

_Alex Beregovsky, Managing Director at Marlin Equity Partners_

Upon completion of necessary approvals, Alex Beregovsky will join ABBYY's Board of Directors. Beregovsky is a Managing Director and member of the flagship fund Investment Committee at Marlin.
