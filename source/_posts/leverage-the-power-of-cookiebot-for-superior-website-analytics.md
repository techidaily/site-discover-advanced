ABBYY®, a leading provider of document recognition, data capture and linguistic technologies and services, in partnership with **Forefront Technologies** and **Skolkovo Foundation**, will participate in **GITEX Tech Week 2016**. GITEX is one of the largest and most important global Information and communication technology events. It will be held on [October 16-20, 2016 at the Dubai World Trade Center](http://www.gitex.com/), Dubai, UAE.

ABBYY has achieved a well-established presence in the Middle East market due to its unique Arabic OCR technology, innovative solutions and strong partners. ABBYY successfully fulfilled several large-scale projects across the region, working with governmental organizations, financial agencies, educational institutions and more.

At GITEX Tech Week 2016, ABBYY will present its latest developments in artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and machine learning. Visitors to ABBYY stands will see how these technologies, incorporated in world-recognized ABBYY FlexiCapture and ABBYY Recognition Server products, are improving business processes to accelerate transactions and drive revenue. They will have an opportunity to directly interact with ABBYY experts and attend real-time demonstrations of focused solutions for processing various types of documents used in financial industry, transportation, education and more.

Among its newest achievements, ABBYY will also present the innovative text analysis technology, ABBYY Compreno. Unlike other solutions based on statistics and rules, ABBYY Compreno performs full semantic and syntactic analysis of text enabling business to “understand”, organize and effectively use unstructured information.

“Data is our job and we do understand its high value for the modern world. However, information itself is not as important as the possibility to share knowledge and experience between people. GITEX is a perfect platform to present our new technologies and to learn about the latest developments of our colleagues,” said Catherine Moskalenko, Senior product manager at ABBYY 3A.
