Intelligent automation company, ABBYY, has opened a new office in Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, to support the relocation of its Ukrainian employees. Engineering resources delivered from the Lithuanian office include customer support, professional services, customer success management, and training. It augments the engineering resources already established in other regions of Europe and the United States.

“Opening a customer-centric engineering center in the vibrant, tech-savvy city of Vilnius accomplishes two objectives – strengthen the high-level of customer support for our industry-leading intelligent process automation solutions, and safely relocate Ukrainian employees to Lithuania,” commented Ulf Persson, CEO at ABBYY. “As a growing global company, we will continue to invest in our technical and people infrastructure to ensure the utmost customer success.”

ABBYY’s new engineering resource center in Lithuania is the company’s 15th global office.
