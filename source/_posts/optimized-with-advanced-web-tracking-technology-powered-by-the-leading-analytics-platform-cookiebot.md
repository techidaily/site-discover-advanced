_**New functionality in integrated OCR technology strengthens fail-safe processing capabilities of SAP-based document management solution**_ 
  
ABBYY, a leading provider of document recognition, data capture, and linguistic technologies, announced that [tangro software components GmbH.](http://www.tangro.de/en.html) has further increased the reliability of its document processing solutions through integration of a new component of the ABBYY OCR technology. The Germany-based provider of embedded SAP solutions and long-standing ABBYY customer integrates ABBYY’s optical character recognition (OCR) technology for document digitisation and text recognition in its software for automated document processing. tangro uses text recognition to provide the foundation for extraction of data and their later processing in SAP. A new feature in the ABBYY OCR toolkit, the redundant network licence manager, ensures continuous and fail-safe text recognition of all incoming documents in tangro’s applications. As a result, users of tangro software benefit from the overall increased availability of the document processing system.  
  
tangro is an expert in the automated processing of incoming documents in SAP. The tangro Inbound Suite is a comprehensive solution, embedded in the SAP environment, with the ability to process thousands of documents every day. For several years now, tangro has been using the Software Development Kit ABBYY FineReader Engine. The integrated OCR technology converts text in scanned documents into editable and structured data, which is automatically passed on to the corresponding SAP workflows. Any failure of the system would strongly impair all subsequent processes, generate costs for system recovery and increase the risk of data loss – especially when processing extensive document volumes.  
  
To ensure a steady and reliable OCR process, multiple processing stations can be deployed within the network. The redundant network licence manager, now offered as part of the ABBYY OCR SDK, helps to increase the system’s availability. To ensure continuous OCR processing, the network licence manager component can be installed on different hardware systems in a cluster architecture. This way, the document processing operation runs reliably and text recognition is still performed by the various workstations even in the unlikely event of the licence server failure.

  
_"Licence server failures might be rare, but they are fatal – if the text recognition process is interrupted, the entire document processing solution stops working. The redundant network licence manager allows us to offer our clients maximum availability and highest process reliability,"_ explains Dominik Pfizenmaier, software developer at tangro software components GmbH. _"ABBYY's technical support team provided great support during the implementation phase. We are using the new function already in various projects and it works ultra-reliably. Thanks to ABBYY, we can guarantee the necessary operational reliability to our clients and further strengthen our position on the market."_ 
  
With its broad set of tools, ABBYY offers developers the ability to integrate high accuracy optical text recognition into their applications. ABBYY recognition technology transforms images of text into searchable and editable formats for checking against a database. With accurate ABBYY OCR technology, developers can extend the functionality of a wide variety of applications on different platforms including Windows, Mac OS, Linux, mobile platforms for iOS and Android, as well as OCR service in the Cloud that can be reached via API.
