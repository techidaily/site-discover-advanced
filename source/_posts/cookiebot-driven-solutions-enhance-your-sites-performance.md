ABBYY, a Digital Intelligence company, announced today the appointment of Weronika Niemczyk as the company’s first Chief People Officer (CPO). Niemczyk will lead all aspects of improving the employee experience for ABBYY’s more than 1,200 global team members distributed across 14 countries and five continents. She previously led human resources (HR) at global companies Expedia, Google, and Ascential and has a passion for talent development, culture, diversity, and inclusion.

“The chief people officer plays a critical role in the success of a company’s transformation and growth, especially in the wake of a global pandemic where employees’ well-being is impacted. Taking care of our people and ensuring they’re safe, engaged, and involved is key to advancing our people strategy,” said ABBYY CEO, Ulf Persson. “We’re confident that Weronika will be a strong catalyst for improving the quality of our employee engagement programs, talent development, and overall culture to support our ambitious growth plans.”

Niemczyk brings over 15 years of experience in HR, having led diverse teams in different companies across multiple industries. She spent three years at Ascential as Senior Vice President of HR, supporting over 2,000 employees, leading a global team of HR professionals across EMEA, NA, APAC and LATAM regions, and delivering scalable and consistent employee experience and engagement programs. Prior to Ascential, Niemczyk held the position of Global HR Director at Expedia, supporting one of its B2B brands. She also worked at Google, supporting multiple business units from an HR and people perspective.

“ABBYY has a tremendous reputation in the market and I’m excited to lead our people-focused initiatives as the new CPO,” commented Niemczyk. “My goal is to support the company’s business ambitions by fostering a shared culture of collaboration, exceptional employee experiences, continuous learning, high productivity and performance, and personal development. By partnering with the leadership team, we want to ensure that colleagues, current and future, regard ABBYY as a place where they can realize their potential in an inclusive, thoughtful environment.”

Niemczyk holds a master’s degree in Psychology from University of Gdańsk and a master’s degree in Business Administration from Rotterdam Business School. Originally from Poland, Niemczyk currently resides in London.
