## Best Practices for your Word Documents Safety

If you use word heavily for work or life, here are some tips for avoid the pain of unsaved word document.

* Buy an Office 365 subscription if you can. The new cloud-based office allows you to use the unique Autosave function with cloud storage like OneDrive. This combination is the safest system to keep your word files safe so far.
* Save your files timely. There are always risks that autosave and autorecover can’t recover your file right!
* Use fewer plugins, keep your word stable. The word crashed is usually caused by some plugin which let you lose the data, and not every crash can trigger the word autorecover!
* Turn on your Autosave/Autorecover in word options to make sure the word will save your files when shit happens.
* Open the word files from trusted source, Using the well-known anti-virus software to avoid the virus attack for Microsoft word.

Also, we may also face other problems besides word document not saved, such as lost word document, deleted word document and even corrupted word file for recovering.
