* Save your files timely. There are always risks that autosave and autorecover can’t recover your file right!
* Use fewer plugins, keep your word stable. The word crashed is usually caused by some plugin which let you lose the data, and not every crash can trigger the word autorecover!
* Turn on your Autosave/Autorecover in word options to make sure the word will save your files when shit happens.
* Open the word files from trusted source, Using the well-known anti-virus software to avoid the virus attack for Microsoft word.
