After launching ABBYY Vantage and Marketplace earlier this year, ABBYY, a digital intelligence company, is proud to announce that the platform is now publicly available and report the growing momentum for the industry’s first no-code, cloud-first intelligent document processing (IDP) platform and skills that address organizations’ needs to make quicker decisions while increasing productivity. ABBYY will host a broadcast event to celebrate ABBYY Vantage on **Tuesday, October 12, at 10 a.m. PST/1 p.m. EST**. For more details and to register for free, visit [www.abbyy.com/vantage-broadcast](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/).

[ABBYY Vantage](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) delivers document skills for RPA robots, automation systems, chatbots, and mobile solutions, enabling organizations to gain insights from documents and content. The platform accelerates the scale of innovation by using technology in new ways—all with less time, talent shortages, and new remote working conditions. [ABBYY Marketplace](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) offers the first digital marketplace for processing and understanding enterprise documents that provides a rich collection of skills, connectors, and assets. More than 500 organizations have provided overwhelmingly positive feedback about ABBYY’s new way of document processing and over 100 successful trials have begun since the general release last month, attracting a considerable amount of business interest in the solutions, including four of the top U.S. banks and many cloud-based companies.

_“The democratization of development is the key to the future of digital business. And low-code/no-code platforms, like ABBYY Vantage that allow less technical workers to develop applications with little to no code experience, are leading the charge to a world where this is a normal skill for business workers,”_ said **Bruce Orcutt, Senior Vice President, Head of Product Marketing at ABBYY.** _“We’re thrilled to offer unrivaled solutions that are gaining more and more interest from organizations across the globe and that empower companies to work smarter and deliver value to customers when it matters most. Instead of struggling with complex design and setup tools, training, business rules, and more, we have a solution that has already built it for you and can deliver it to you as an easily consumable and deployable skill. We’ve ultimately designed a solution that unlocks opportunities for true business transformation.”_

ABBYY has made connectors available for many systems and automation tools today, including out-of-the-box connectors for [Alteryx](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/), [UiPath](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/), [Blue Prism](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/), Automation Anywhere, [Microsoft (Power Automate)](https://marketplace.abbyy.com/root/abbyy-vantage-connector-microsoft-power-automate/ "Vantage Connector for Microsoft Power Automate") and partner-built connectors for [Kryon](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/), I[ncture Cherrywork®](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/), Pegasystems, [Pipefy](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/), NICE, [Cognigy](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/), [Toca](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/), [Netcontent®](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) and many others.

_“The initial results we’ve seen with ABBYY Vantage are quite incredible,”_ said **Mathias Fransen, Managing Director for RoboRana.** _“Along with our platform, Vantage simplifies and automates the end-to-end process with other intelligent automation platforms. I’m really looking forward to helping our customers solve their documents and unstructured data challenges. Together we offer the best of both worlds and achieve the unexpected.”_

ABBYY has changed the way organizations approach document processing through Vantage. The platform empowers citizen developers to have more control within intelligent automation initiatives and quickly get started with all types of high-value use cases that move the business forward, such as invoice processing, accounts receivable, claims processing, mortgage lending, and customer onboarding. The platform drives change across the entire organization by enabling business users to digitize operations faster without complete reliance on IT: with Vantage, they can derive critical insights from documents on a large scale. Through empowering individual users, Vantage allows business leaders to accelerate automation strategies, improve customer experience, lower risk, and increase productivity.

ABBYY Marketplace comes pre-loaded with skills covering a variety of use cases and industries, with both ABBYY developed skills and skills built and published by partners to automate all types of content-centric processes—creating the platform’s saying, “There’s a skill for that!” Document skills, a term used by ABBYY for the new solution, enable intelligent automation platforms, digital workers, and automation robots to intelligently process business documents in a human-like manner—to understand, extract meaning, and make decisions. Skills are a no-code design approach that allow citizen developers to utilize the power of Vantage intelligent document services to design and train machine learning models for all types of documents—from invoices and purchase orders to bank statements, loan applications, and virtually any type of document.

ABBYY is also proud to share that its Vantage and Marketplace solutions have recently been named on of [KMWorld’s Trend-Setting Products of 2021](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/). The list is curated by KMWorld Magazine and showcases advanced products and services—offerings that are designed to help organizations derive greater benefit from their information, share knowledge efficiently, make better decisions, enable compliance, effectively support employees, and communicate seamlessly with customers.
